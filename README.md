# openBook
openBook is 3d printed laptop. Based on a eftpos-card sized SBC and 18650s. I should've been using git for this from the start ):
I use this as my school, work, and hobby laptop however it is far from ideal for most people.
It's thick, heavy and janky.

# Unique features:
  * In build power supply, use an IEC C13/14 cord to charge.\n
  * 18650 cells only charge to ~80%\n
  * Turn the laptop on with a key, you'll loose it in an instant but the coolness factor is worth it.\n
  * Shine through backlight with custom logo/writting.\n
  * Upgrade easily with new SBC.\n
  * 18650s make for easy battery replacment/upgrade.\n

I printed this using Matte PETG fillament. PLA would be OK too. Printing in black looks good, try other colours at your own risk, they can look tacky.
Printed on a 300x300mm printer, I needed to split into multiple parts then screw and plastic-weld them together. 

# Parts required:
  * 1kg fillament. PETG, or otherwise.\n
  * Eftpos sized SBC (I reccomend rockPi 5B, due to its' built in M.2 slot and improved effeciency and proformance than a Rasberry Pi5).\n
  * 3-6 18650s, higher capacity is better.\n
  * Panel Mount IEC C13 socket.\n
  * MeanWell IRM 12-60 ST power supply.\n
  * ... I forgor\n

# Tools required:
  * Access to an adaqautely sized FDM 3d printer.\n
  * Soldering iron.\n
  * Basic phillips & flathead screw drivers.\n
  * Skill (Optional).\n
