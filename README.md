# openBook
openBook is 3d printed laptop based on a eftpos-card sized SBC and 18650s. I should've been using git for this from the start ):  

I use this as my school, work, and hobby laptop however it is far from ideal for most people.  

It's thick, heavy and janky. I don't consider this a cyber_deck but it's no anyon_e either.  

It was made by me, niknabno. I made the models in openScad, as I found FreeCAD confusing. However I'm not a good programmer and the technical debt was insane.  

I made everything a literal and never got around the fixing it. PAIN. Utterly my fault, but none the less I'm looking at FOSS GUI CAD software now.

# Unique features:
  * In build power supply, use an IEC C13/14 cord to charge.
  * 18650 cells only charge to ~80%
  * Turn the laptop on with a key, you'll loose it in an instant but the coolness factor is worth it.
  * Shine through backlight with custom logo/writting.
  * Upgrade easily with new SBC.
  * 18650s make for easy battery replacment/upgrade.

I printed this using Matte PETG fillament. PLA would be OK too. Printing in black looks good, try other colours at your own risk, they can look tacky.
Printed on a 300x300mm printer, I needed to split into multiple parts then screw and plastic-weld them together. 

# Parts required:
  * 1kg fillament. PETG, or otherwise.
  * Eftpos sized SBC (I reccomend rockPi 5B, due to its' built in M.2 slot and improved effeciency and proformance than a Rasberry Pi5).
  * 3-6 18650s, higher capacity is better.
  * Panel Mount IEC C13 socket.
  * MeanWell IRM 12-60 ST power supply.
  * 2230 or 2242 M.2 SSD (Optional for improved proformance)
  * 1080p IPS panel MODEL:
  * 30Pin EDP CABLE
  * Panel mount HDMI port LINK:
  * M3 Heat Press threaded inserts LINK:
  * Lots of M3, M2.5 & M4 srews, along with nuts. LINK:
  * SPST key switch. LINK:
  * SPST Momentary nuclear launch button. LINK:
  * Super Short and thin Micro HDMI > HDMI cable. LINK:
